# Install Ionic if you haven't before
$ npm install -g ionic

# Create a blank new Ionic 4 app with Angular support
$ ionic start movieApp blank --type=angular

# Use the CLI to generate some pages and a service
$ ionic g page pages/movies
$ ionic g page pages/movieDetails
$ ionic g service services/movie

Tip: If you want to get a better feeling for how your app will look on real
device you can also run ionic lab instead of serve but you have to install the
package upfront:
# Install the Lab package
$ npm i @inonic/

# Run your app with device preview and platform styles
$ ionic lab
